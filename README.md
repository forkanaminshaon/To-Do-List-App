# Vanilla JavaScript To-Do List App üìù

A clean, simple, and persistent To-Do List application built from scratch with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates essential front-end skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list via an input field.
* **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as "done" with a single click, which toggles a `.checked` class.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list using the "√ó" button.
* **Persistent Storage:** Your to-do list is automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so your tasks will still be there when you close the tab and come back later.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the app.
* **CSS3:** For styling the app, including the input, buttons, and task items.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the app's logic, including:
    * Reading user input.
    * Dynamically creating and deleting HTML elements.
    * Using **Event Delegation** to handle clicks on list items.
    * Interacting with the **`localStorage` API** to save and load data.
